# Things to implement
### math / compsci
- product and semi-direct product between groups
- change nodes so that they include also the order of the node (information about the node...)


### visual
- different labels for the graph, functinos turns labels of permutations into labels like aaababaa where a and b are the generators
- change what the nodes look like, rectangles for elements of order 2 (or circle), triangles for elements of order 3, squares etc... polygons... 
- color the arrows based on which generator was used
